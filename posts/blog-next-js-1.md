I want to use for my work environment the [https://github.com/isfegu/misenplace.node](Mise en place) proposed by [https://github.com/isfegu](isfegu).

I will start more or less following documentation in [https://nextjs.org/learn](https://nextjs.org/learn).
 
## 1.1 Create Next App
 
I open terminal, `cd` into the directory I want to create the app in, and run the following command:
 
```bash[class="line-numbers"][class="contained"][class="hide-numbers"]
yarn create next-app --typescript blog
```
 
In this case I want to use typescript and the name for the app will be just blog.
