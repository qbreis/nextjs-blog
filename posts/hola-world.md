Testing pre code in blog:

```bash[class="line-numbers"][data-line="2,4"]
yarn add bulma
yarn add bulma
<span class="z">yarn add bulma</span>
yarn add bulma
```
yarn add bulma
```bash
yarn add bulma
yarn add bulma
```

```js[class="line-numbers"][class="hide-numbers"][data-line="2,4"]
const hola = 'world';

There’s a Prism.js line-highlight plugin; unfortunately, it is not integrated with remark-prism. The plugin works by analyzing the formatted code’s position in the DOM, and manually highlights lines based on that information. That’s impossible with the remark-prism plugin since there is no DOM at the time the plugin runs. This is, after all, static site generation. Next.js is running our Markdown through a build step and generating HTML to render the blog. All of this Prism.js code runs during this static site generation, when there is no DOM.
yarn add bulma
yarn add bulma
yarn add bulma
yarn add bulma
yarn add bulma
yarn add bulma

```

```javascript {2}
const hola = 'world';
// comment 1
// line 2 or 3 or 4
```
